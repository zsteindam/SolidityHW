For this assignment we created three contracts:

AssociateProfitSplitter.sol
TieredProfitSplitter.sol
DeferredEquityPlan.sol

First we deployed on the local host and we tested the transactions locally, moving ethereum around between test accounts.

Then we deploayed the contract on the Ropsten network and tests the transactions there.

Specifially the DefferredEquityPlan contract was deployed at "0xea9047D7e5F931F6d1c2eB5642F19465651845Ba"
I ussed the employee address as  "0x4410efd970E60298EACfe1c50244f74aF708DA0c".
